      content: 'FemtoMarch Medical has been deeply engaged in the vertical field of "optics-laser-ophthalmic laser" for ten years. We have independently conquered four core technologies: medical-grade femtosecond lasers, high-precision large-field 3D optical scanning, real-time closed-loop monitoring and control, and customized refractive correction algorithms. We launched the domestic femtosecond laser treatment system for refractive and corneal surgery — the mass production prototype passed the national type test in June 2025. The company is committed to making femtosecond laser the "second lancet" for ophthalmologists, reshaping refractive surgery paradigm with "Chinese precision", empowering doctors and patients with safe, fast, precise and cost-effective surgical upgrades, creating a replicable technology-industry closed loop, leading the domestic high-end ophthalmic femtosecond laser track, breaking the import monopoly and setting a new benchmark for localization.',
